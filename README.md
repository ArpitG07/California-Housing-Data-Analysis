# California Housing Data Analysis
 This [project](C:\Users\Arpit Gautam\Desktop\GitHub Files\GitHub Files\California-Housing-Data-Analysis\California Housing Data Analysis.ipynb) analyses California housing dataset using Python programming language. The project has been executed on Google Colab.
 
# Dataset
 Here is an elaborative explanation of the [dataset](C:\Users\Arpit Gautam\Desktop\GitHub Files\GitHub Files\California-Housing-Data-Analysis\California Housing Dataset.xlsx).

 **INTRODUCTION**

*The given dataset describes California housing data. We will be using this dataset to out the answers to the questions given in the mandatory project assignment. These questions include exercises range from computing the average median income of the dataset or a part of it, dropiping, adding a column from the dataset, creating a new dataset by adding a new column to the existing dataset to representing distribution of data on an appropriate graph.*

*The dataset contains the folowing characteristics:*


**Longitude**: *A numerical datatype (continuous data) that represents the distance of a house located horizontally from west to east. Increase in Longitude value means directional move towards West.*

**Latitude**: *A numerical datatype (continuous data) that represents the distance of a house located vertically from South to North. Increase in Latitude value means directional move towards North.*

**housing_median_age**: *A numerical datatype (continuous data) that represents the median age of a house.*

**total_rooms**: *A numeric datatype (discrete data) that represents total number of rooms within a block.*

**total_bedrooms**: *A numeric datatype (discrete data) that represents total number of bedrooms within a block.*

**population**: *A numeric datatype (discrete data) that represents total number of people having resident in a block*

**household**: A numeric datatype (discrete data) that represents total number of households, a group of people having resident within a homeunit.

**median_income**: *A numeric datatype (continuous data) that represents Median income of households within a block of houses, measured in tens of thousands of USD.*

**median_house_value**: *A numeric datatype (continuous data) that represents Median house value for households within a block (in USD).*

**Ocean_proximity**: *A qualitative datatype (nominal data) that represents location of a house with respect to ocean.*

# Concepts Used
 This project is filled with Statistical analysis involving concepts like Mean, Median, Standard Deviation and Skewness. The concepts and libraries of Python used in this analysis range from Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, etc. Matplotlib has been used to create a few Histogram plots and Seaborn contributed to a couple of neat Scatter plots.
